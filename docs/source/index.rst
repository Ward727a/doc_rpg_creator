Welcome to RPG Creator documentation!
=====================================

**RPG Creator** is a free, open-source and modular alternative to the popular
RPG Maker software.

This software can be used to create your very own RPG game for free!
It can be totally modified to your own taste, and there is a plugin system
to add your own features inside the software!

This software is fully created by only one person,
for free and purely out of passion, so please, be patient!

.. note::

   This project is under active development. For now, there is no public version of the software.

.. note::

   This documentation is open-source! (https://github.com/Ward727a/doc_rpg_creator).

.. warning::

   This documentation is still in a WIP state. There will be some information that is missing, but I will add them later on!
