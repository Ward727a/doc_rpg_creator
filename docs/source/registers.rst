Registers
===============
It's very important to know about the registers system to be able to create plugin / edit interface of the software and know how the software know what has been added, what exist and what doesn't exist.

The registers is a system that will get all item, object, UI, effect, characters, ... of the software / game to create a "database" accessible anywhere in the software / game.

For example, when you create an UI you need to register the UI in the UIRegister before the software or any other script can use it.
